保持意外链接的必要性。

昨晚参加Tech NZ，其实还是比较有趣，有替老板参加的印度懵逼小哥，有脑子灵活什么都感兴趣的毛利小哥，有蝴蝶式四处飞采的中国小姑娘，but sounds interesting and nothing for deep discussion。 当然，最后还serendipity 意外聊了Sarah并且她主动提出make connection。 

But of course I didn't prepared the following steps of after meet-up connection. In fact, I even didn't have linkedin app and also not configued what's app. Maybe my base is medium, so the English writing of Medium should be continue one day. Anyway, the most important thing is the content and common interest. We share the same interest in the area of blockchain. Specifically, the bitcoin. And then we turn to the deep conversation of cognitive science including psychology. We really enjoy this topic and she shared the book of Thinking fast and slow. I shared the up-to-date knowledge that I just learned from Yang. She was obviously very attracted by these brand-new knowledge and immersed in it.

真正的深度链接一定是小众兴趣爱好，或者"我们和其他人都不一样"，这样会激发出强大的心流和共同体，一个更小的共同体的价值和意义比泛泛之交在一定层面、阶段可能更适合我。
